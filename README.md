# Plotly_deployment

This project is to display the use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web and to be familiar with HTML and basic JavaScript. The project also gives my audience the opportunity to draw the same conclusion that I got during the project as they would be able to use interactive features such as buttons, dropdowns as well as to retrieve data from external sources from csv files and API calls. The final stage is to deploy a data visualization to the web.

The project is to find bacterial species which have the abilities synthesize proteins to taste like beef which scientific lab companies have had success in performing this objective. By researching sources like algae, fungi, meat, and microorganisms found on plants to meet the goal even though there are still searching to find the perfect bacterial to change one of these sources to taste like beef. The hypothesis is to show either bacterial find in belly button can be used to synthesize meat, algae, or fungi to taste like beef.
